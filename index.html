			<p>Imagine flying 4,000 feet over the Willamette Valley, in a two-seater airplane, with a 180-degree view, that on a clear day, can range from the snowcapped heights of Mt. Hood in the north, to the blue tint of Crater Lake in the south. </p>
			<p>To those in the Lane Aviation Program, this is an sight they see daily, and through the efforts of director Steve Boulton, the students now get to do this from the comfort of two newly acquired RV-12 light sport aircrafts. </p>
			<p>“The idea of the purchase of these two planes was to be able to allow the students to learn how to fly in a plane that was more conducive to teaching and learning,” Boulton said. </p>

			<p>According to Boulton, these new airplanes come equipped with many instruments and a state-of-the art design that makes these planes more maneuverable to fly than others in their current fleet. </p>
			<p>“First of all, these planes have a lighter shell than the planes in our current fleet,” Boulton said. “Having a lighter shell allows students to have more control over the direction of the plane while in the air.”</p>
			<p>Another factor that contributes to these two planes being better for instruction is their full autopilot capability. The RV-12’s come from the factory with full autopilot, and Boulton says this allows him to provide one-on-one instruction with the students without the students having to focus their attention on flying the plane. </p>
			<p>For a typical training flight, Boulton likes to average around 2 to 2.5 hour flights. The reason for this is because the planes they currently own carry enough fuel for a maximum three-hour flight. But, these new RV-12’s have a capacity for 20 gallons, which according to Boulton gives them the option to be in the air around three hours. </p>

		<div class="item"><img src="media/images/airplanes12.jpg" alt="Airplanes"><p>One of the main differences between these new planes, and their current fleet, is the single-wheeled axles, which allow the plane to be turned 360 degrees from a dead stop. This increased maneuverability provides studdents an easier experience when they're first learing to fly, according to director Steve Boulton. </p></div>

			<p>In addition to these two main features, the RV-12’s are equipped with ergonomically designed seating, durable interior matte paint, upholstered interior, Aux inputs and 12-volt power outlets and day and night LED lighting for added safety. </p>
			<p>The purchase of these planes signifies an accomplishment in Boulton’s career as director of the program. When he first took over as director five years ago, Boulton was told he had a budget of zero for advertising and expansion. </p>
			<p>“I was barely able to sustain the program,” Boulton said. “There were a few years in there where I would meet with the president of Lane Community College, and he would threaten to take away from the already limited funds I had for my program.”</p>
			<p>The RV-12’s are built at Synergy Air; a company based out of the Eugene airport that trains those interested in the mechanics of aviation how to build planes. Chris Thelan, a production test pilot with Synergy, feels the RV-12’s are easier for a beginner pilot to learn in than any of the other models they produce. </p>
			<p>“One of the biggest things that makes these easier to fly is that they can be flown at slower airspeeds,” Thelan said. “For example, in a typical light sport aircraft, you have to approach the runway at about 65 knots, but in the RV-12’s, you can approach the runway at about 55 knots, making them easier to handle for beginners.”</p>

				During a typical training flight, Boulton says that they range from 4,000-10,000 feet depending on the type of training. Boulton also says that one of his favorite things about being in the air is that you're in control of where you go, and you can see as far as the horizon allows.

			<p>As director of the program, Boulton wants to help graduates secure positions in this highly competitive industry. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there was an estimated 104,000 jobs for commercial pilots in 2012, parallel to the estimated 119,119 who received pilot certifications. </p>
			<p>Boulton hopes to use these new planes as a way to strengthen the credibility of the program for the benefit of the students. </p>
			<p>“In our industry, I’m noticing a need for more, well-trained pilots,” Boulton said. “With these RV-12’s, I think we’re going to be able to both expand our program, and train pilots in such a fashion that they’ll be able to get good, well-paying jobs.”</p>
