			<p>SPRINGFIELD &mdash; About 250 employees face an uncertain future after a spectacular fire, which started in a dryer and caused numerous explosions, quickly destroyed the Springfield Plywood and Veneer mill Thursday afternoon.</p>

				Steve Boulton, director of the Lane Aviation Academy, has been the director of the program for about 5 years now. When he started, he was told his budget for expansion was zero. Through his fundraising efforts, which include several grants, Boulton was able to secure the purchase of two new RV-12's, which cost $115,000 each. The increased maneuverability gives students who have never flown before an easier opportunity when they go in teh air for the first time.

			<p>About 100 firefighters from seven agencies were dispatched to fight the fire, which prompted officials to briefly declare an evacuation within a one-mile radius of the plant at 1651 South F St.</p>
			<p>The evacuation notice was rescinded about 7 p.m. Firefighters continued their watch overnight.</p>
			<p>The blaze, which was reported shortly after 4:30 p.m., sent an ominous plume of black smoke high into the hot summer air that area residents could see for miles. Dozens of people lined South A Street to capture the first hour of the fiery scene on their smartphones and cameras as traffic on the thoroughfare slowed to a crawl. Police officers temporarily blocked side streets near the mill.</p>

			<p>Employees at the scene when the fire broke out said they raced to safety as the fast-moving fire began consuming the mill within minutes. No injuries of employees or firefighters were reported. More than 100 people were believed to be working at the mill at the time the fire started,</p>
			<p>Dewayne Hunter, 40, a forklift driver at the mill, said he was in the finish yard when a large dryer, used to dry wet veneer, caught fire and then ignited debris in the air.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The fire was, like, right there in my face,&rdquo; he said.</p>

			<p>The 33-acre mill is owned by privately held Swanson Group Mfg. LLC, based in Glendale. It is one of the family-owned business&rsquo; four wood products mills in Oregon.</p>
			<p>The complex consisted of about 200,000 square feet of buildings.</p>
			<p>The mill sits to the south of a rail line, which was closed temporarily Thursday. Immediately north of the line is the city of Springfield&rsquo;s public works maintenance headquarters. Immediately to the south of the mill is the Knife River gravel mine.</p>

				During a typical training flight, Boulton says that they range from 4,000-10,000 feet depending on the type of training. Boulton also says that one of his favorite things about being in the air is that you're in control of where you go, and you can see as far as the horizon allows.

			<p>Among the onlookers on South A Street was Cliff Moore, 56, of Springfield, who said he was driving down Main Street when he first saw the smoke from around 28th Street. He said that in a town the size of Springfield, most everyone knows someone who works at the mill.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see this every day, and it&rsquo;s hard to believe you&rsquo;re seeing it,&rdquo; he said with his camera aimed at the fiery scene.</p>
			<p>Employees were left in a state of disbelief. About 6 p.m., some employees boarded a Lane Transit District bus that ferried them back to the mill&rsquo;s parking lot so that they could drive their vehicles home.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Obviously, we&rsquo;re not going to have a job to come back to on Monday,&rdquo; Hunter said.</p>
